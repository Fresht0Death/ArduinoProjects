# ArduinoProjects

In an attempt to better understand embedded systems and embedded C, I am building small projects that track data, interact with hardware, and eventually log results. Each project is meant to build on my knowledge of C/C++, Arduino, and embedded systems concepts.

** Project README's have wiring and hardware needed. **

### 1. sensorTemp
**Description:**  
Reads temperature from a TMP36 sensor, tracks the **hottest and coldest values of the day (Â°F)**, and displays temperature ranges with **3 LEDs (Â°C bands)**.

**Features:**
- Converts analog readings â†’ voltage â†’ Â°C and Â°F
- Tracks min/max in Â°F
- LED indicators show temperature zones based on Â°C thresholds
- Prints live readings + min/max to Serial Monitor
